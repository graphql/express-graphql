GraphQL HTTP Server Middleware
==============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphql/express-graphql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/graphql/express-graphql)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/graphql/express-graphql/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/graphql/express-graphql?branch=master)

Create a GraphQL HTTP server with any HTTP web framework that supports connect styled middleware include [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) itself and [Express](http://expressjs.com).

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save express-graphql
```

Then mount `express-graphql` at any point as middleware with your server framework of choice:

```js
import graphqlHTTP from 'express-graphql';

const app = express();

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema: MyGraphQLSchema,
  graphiql: true
}));

app.listen(3000);
```

## Options

The `graphqlHTTP` function accepts the following options:

  * **`schema`**: A `GraphQLSchema` instance from [`graphql-js`][].
    A `schema` *must* be provided.

  * **`context`**: A value to pass as the `context` to the `graphql()`
    function from [`graphql-js`][].

  * **`rootValue`**: A value to pass as the `rootValue` to the `graphql()`
    function from [`graphql-js`][].

  * **`pretty`**: If `true`, any JSON response will be pretty-printed.

  * **`formatError`**: An optional function which will be used to format any
    errors produced by fulfilling a GraphQL operation. If no function is
    provided, GraphQL's default spec-compliant [`formatError`][] function will
    be used.

  * **`validationRules`**: Optional additional validation rules queries must
    satisfy in addition to those defined by the GraphQL spec.

  * **`graphiql`**: If `true`, may present [GraphiQL][] when loaded directly
    from a browser (a useful tool for debugging and exploration).

  * **`handleErrors`**: An optional function which will be used to handle any errors
    encountered by fulfilling a GraphQL operation. If no function is provided, Errors
    will default to normal behavior and return in `errors` array.


## Debugging

During development, it's useful to get more information from errors, such as
stack traces. Providing a function to `formatError` enables this:

```js
formatError: error => ({
  message: error.message,
  locations: error.locations,
  stack: error.stack
})
```


## HTTP Usage

Once installed at a path, `express-graphql` will accept requests with
the parameters:

  * **`query`**: A string GraphQL document to be executed.

  * **`variables`**: The runtime values to use for any GraphQL query variables
    as a JSON object.

  * **`operationName`**: If the provided `query` contains multiple named
    operations, this specifies which operation should be executed. If not
    provided, a 400 error will be returned if the `query` contains multiple
    named operations.

  * **`raw`**: If the `graphiql` option is enabled and the `raw` parameter is
    provided raw JSON will always be returned instead of GraphiQL even when
    loaded from a browser.

GraphQL will first look for each parameter in the URL's query-string:

```
/graphql?query=query+getUser($id:ID){user(id:$id){name}}&variables={"id":"4"}
```

If not found in the query-string, it will look in the POST request body.

If a previous middleware has already parsed the POST body, the `request.body`
value will be used. Use [`multer`][] or a similar middleware to add support
for `multipart/form-data` content, which may be useful for GraphQL mutations
involving uploading files. See an [example using multer](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql/blob/master/src/__tests__/http-test.js#L650).

If the POST body has not yet been parsed, express-graphql will interpret it
depending on the provided *Content-Type* header.

  * **`application/json`**: the POST body will be parsed as a JSON
    object of parameters.

  * **`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`**: this POST body will be
    parsed as a url-encoded string of key-value pairs.

  * **`application/graphql`**: The POST body will be parsed as GraphQL
    query string, which provides the `query` parameter.


## Advanced Options

In order to support advanced scenarios such as installing a GraphQL server on a
dynamic endpoint or accessing the current authentication information,
`express-graphql` allows options to be provided as a function of each
express request, and that function may return either an options object, or a
Promise for an options object.

This example uses [`express-session`][] to provide GraphQL with the currently
logged-in session as the `context` of the query execution.

```js
import session from 'express-session';
import graphqlHTTP from 'express-graphql';

const app = express();

app.use(session({ secret: 'keyboard cat', cookie: { maxAge: 60000 }}));

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP(request => ({
  schema: MySessionAwareGraphQLSchema,
  context: request.session,
  graphiql: true
})));
```

Then in your type definitions, access via the third "context" argument in your
`resolve` function:

```js
new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'MyType',
  fields: {
    myField: {
      type: GraphQLString,
      resolve(parentValue, args, session) {
        // use `session` here
      }
    }
  }
});
```
