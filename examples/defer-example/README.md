# Example usage

This is the bare minimum that one needs in order to setup GraphQL server that supports @defer and a client that consumes it.

## Server setup

1. cd to /server
2. use ``npm install``
3. start the server with `` node server.js ``

## Client setup

1. cd to /client
2. use ``node client.js`` to execute the example deferred query

Have fun!
